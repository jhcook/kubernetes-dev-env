## Rancher on RKE2

We endeavour to keep Kubernetes platforms, e.g., OCP, RKE2, MicroK8s, and
Minikube, separate from applications and higher-level components such as
Prometheus. In the home directory of this repo is [`quickstart.sh`](../../quickstart.sh) which demonstrates a
use case installing Rancher on Minikube. In this [tutorial](./rancher_rke2.md), we will demonstrate using
[Canonical Multipass](https://multipass.run) to install Rancher and Prometheus
with [Google Online Boutique](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo).
