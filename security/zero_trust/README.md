# Zero Trust

## Introduction
Zero Trust Networks are resilient even when attackers manage to breach applications or infrastructure. They make it hard for attackers to move laterally, and reconnaissance activities easier to spot.

Organizations that embrace the change control model in this How-To will be able to tightly secure their network without imposing a drag on innovation in their applications. Security teams can be enablers of business value, not roadblocks.
